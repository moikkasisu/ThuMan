    <h2>The Man Who Was Thursday</h2>
    
    <p>F:  Hey, you know, you will always live in your past,</p>
    <p>&nbsp...<i>forever</i> on the road</p>
    
    <p>M:  Can't we just bury our past and move on? </p>
  
    <p>F:  I can, but you can't, you would not be able to.</p>
    <p>(In silent darkness, she lighted another cigarette, slowly, white smoke rings swirled up into the air above them...)</p>
    
    <p>“The air was soft, the stars so fine, the promise of every cobbled alley so great, that I thought I was in a dream.” She thought of this quote.</p>
